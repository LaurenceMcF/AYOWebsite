    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Founded in 1948, AYO was the first youth orchestra established in the
  Southern Hemisphere, designed to bridge the gap between school orchestras
  and adult professional groups. Since then, more than 2,600 young adults from
  diverse cultural and social backgrounds have passed through the ranks of the
  orchestra, having received expert training in orchestral playing. No other
  orchestral organisation or institution in New Zealand provides such a
  comprehensive programme to musicians up to the age of 28. </p>

      <div class="push-down"></div>

      <h2>Touring</h2>
      <p>The orchestra's training role is paramount, however it has developed
      an extended role as a performing and touring symphony orchestra. The
      orchestra regularly presents concerts in centres throughout New Zealand
      and has toured to Australia, New Caledonia, North America, and Europe.
      In August 2011, AYO travelled to Europe, being the first ensemble from
      New Zealand invited to perform at the renowned Young Euro Classic
      Festival in Berlin, Germany. In 2013, the orchestra toured the length
      of the South Island with concerts in Dunedin, Gore, Te Anau, Wanaka,
      Westport, and Nelson.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The orchestra also showcases young soloists and composers. The AYO
  Concerto Competition offers existing orchestra members the chance to
  compete for a concerto appearance with the orchestra.  The orchestra
  accompanied Dame Kiri Te Kanawa in her youth, and more recently John
  Chen and Amitai Pati (Sol3Mio and Lexus Song Quest winner, 2012).</p>

      <h2>Here Plays the Future</h2>
      <p>Not only are we training future musicians to feed into our national
      ensembles and orchestras but we also play an important audience
      development role as our members are likely to be future audiences
      and supporters of the arts.  AYO is a healthy social experience for
      young people and makes an important contribution to the cultural life
      of Auckland and New Zealand.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Alumni</h2>
  <p>Many AYO alumni can be found in leading orchestras and ensembles around the
  world, teaching in conservatories, or performing as soloists and conductors.
  The co-operative structure of the orchestra provides members with
  organisational  and team building skills, engendering dedication, confidence,
  and self-esteem within  a positive peer environment. In today's world, this
  healthy social experience equips  our players with skills and a sense of
  achievement that will support them in whatever career path they choose.
  Indeed, many of our alumni are also found in business, politics,  and other
  professions.</p>
