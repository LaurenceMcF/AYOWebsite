      <div class="detailscontainer"><div class="details">
        With the ‘Rite of Spring’ Stravinsky opened up new and exciting rhythmic
        possibilities to 20th century composers, and together with the dissolution
        of traditional harmony and key relationships there grew an awareness of
        the musical value of the percussion section in creating new and different
        sonorities from anything ever heard before in Western music. The
        percussion section contains the largest range of timbres, and the greatest
        dynamic range of any section of the orchestra and has absorbed
        instruments from many other musical cultures around the world. Gareth
        Farr began his musical career as a percussionist before becoming one of
        New Zealand’s most successful and prolific composers. He has long had a
        fascination with the gamelan music of Indonesia, and how it was possible
        to create intricate and complex structures without the use of the key
        system and harmonies of European musical culture. This had an important
        influence in the development of his compositions. Little Sea Gongs was
        written in 1997 for the percussion quartet “Strike.”

        By the end of the 16th century Venice had become one of the richest and
        most powerful of European states. Commanding a monopoly of trade with
        the east, and an enviously stable constitution, which prevented any
        individual attaining absolute power, its vast wealth was poured into the
        creation of magnificent buildings and works of art. The Basilica of St
        Mark’s became famous all over Europe for its music. The organist and
        official composer of St Mark’s was Giovanni Gabrieli. He utilised the unique
        acoustic properties of the building to create works which would place
        opposing groups of instruments against each other, imitating and echoing
        the various motives from which the music is constructed. He was also the
        first composer to sometimes actually specify the instruments he required.
        The brass players of Venice were justly famous, and the canzoni he wrote
        for them exploits their capabilities to the full.

      <div class="detailscontainer"><div class="details">
        After studying with Schoenberg for two years John Cage was told that in
        order to write music, you must have a feeling for harmony, that he would
        always encounter an obstacle, as though he would come to a wall through
        which he could not pass. His reply was that he would devote his life to
        beating his head against that wall. The music he came to write was never
        based on any feeling for harmony. He sought a different way of listening,
        often incorporating structures created by chance. He became famous with
        his composition 4’33’’ which was actually a piece of performance art. The
        performer and the audience simply being together in the same room
        listening to the sounds around them. Dream was originally written for
        piano in 1948 as the music for a dance piece choreographed by his partner
        Merce Cunningham. It is essentially a single melodic line except for the last
        few bars. It was arranged for violas by Karen Phillips in 1974.

        The harmonic language of the Canzona is quite different from that of my
        other music which is generally highly chromatic and expressionistic.
        Seeking to create a piece which could bring comfort and peace to those
        who hear it I went back to where western harmony began, the music of
        the medieval church. The triad was regarded as a mystical representation
        of the holy trinity as it consisted of three in one. Triple metre was seen as a
        representation of perfection for the same reason, and was notated in the
        form of a circle, which was also seen as a perfect form. The triadic
        harmony of the Canzona is therefore not that of the later key system
        which evolved from it but moves freely between major and minor chords
        as the emotional flow of the music dictates, and it is in triple metre
        throughout. It takes as its basis the Bach chorale Sei Lob und Her’dem
        hochsten Gut (Honour and Praise to the Highest) and develops and
        elaborates elements contained within it.

      <div class="head"><span class="composer">Haydn</span> Symphony No. 100 "Military Symphony"</div>
      <div class="detailscontainer"><div class="details">
        Adagio/Allegro, Allegretto, Menuetto, Finale Presto <br />

        When Handel died in 1759 Haydn was a young man of 27, and when he
        himself died in 1809, Beethoven had already written his “Eroica”
        symphony, so during his lifetime music had undergone the most incredible
        transformation. In 1727 the Austrian court composer and Kapellmeister,
        Fux, published his celebrated treatise on counterpoint ‘Gradus ad
        Parnassum’, and it was from this work that Haydn received his only
        systematic instruction in composition, working through all the exercises by
        himself as he was too poor to be able to pay for instruction. In the
        introduction to the treatise Fux railed against the music of the time stating
        that “music has become almost arbitrary and composers refuse to be
        bound by any rules and principles, detesting the very name of school and
        law like death itself.” There was clearly a revolution in musical style taking
        place and it was Haydn who carried this revolution forward with
        extraordinary energy to create what is now known as the ‘classical style,’
        developing the instrumental forms of the string quartet and the symphony
        and writing a series of masterpieces which were the foundation of all
        those that were to follow. The ‘Military’ Symphony was one of those which
        he wrote for his second visit to London in 1794. In this work he introduced
        what was known at the time as ‘Turkish music’: cymbals, triangle, and bass
        drum. It was these percussion instruments, and the second movement, in
        ‘march’ time, which gave the work its name.

      <div class="head"><span class="composer">Biber</span> Battalia a 10</div>
      <div class="detailscontainer"><div class="details">
        Biber spent almost his entire career in the service of the Archbishop of
        Salzburg, but unlike Mozart who began his career in a similar capacity, his
        exceptional talent was recognized and honoured. He rose to the position
        of Kapellmeister, performed before the Emperor, and was raised by him to
        the nobility. He was the foremost German violinist of his time, and
        although as Kapellmeister he wrote several magnificent masses for
        Salzburg Cathedral, he is nowadays better known for his instrumental
        music, particularly that for the violin. His 15 ‘mystery’ sonatas employ the
        device of ‘scordatura’, which means the instrument is tuned differently for
        each sonata. His ‘passacaglia’ for solo violin is a precursor of the famous
        ‘chaconne’ from the Bach’s D minor partita. Biber was a great master of
        ‘counterpoint’ which is the weaving of different parts together to make a
        harmonious whole, but in the second movement of the ‘Battalia’ he
        demonstrates graphically what happens when each part goes its own way
        without regard for the others. This is symbolic of how nations must work
        together or conflict will result.

      <div class="head"><span class="composer">Humperdinck</span>
         Abendsegen und Traumpantomime from Hansel und Gretel</div>
      <div class="detailscontainer"><div class="details">
        During the course of the nineteenth century an increased awareness grew
        amongst the nations of Europe of their unique cultural and ethnic heritage.
        Although this led to much political unrest and conflict, as subject peoples
        sought independence from their political masters, it also led to a huge
        flowering of creativity in the arts and music, as artists, musicians and
        writers discovered the riches of their folk heritage and history. The music
        dramas of Wagner were a product of this resurgent German nationalism,
        as were the folk tales collected by the brothers Grimm. Humperdinck was
        an ardent disciple of Richard Wagner while his sister Adelheid Wette was
        equally enchanted by the stories she found in Grimm’s Fairy Tales. It was
        her idea for them to write an opera together about Hansel and Gretel. The
        premier was given in 1893, conducted by Richard Strauss, and was an
        immediate success. Unfortunately the nationalism which produced such
        wonderful works also led to the growth of a belligerent militarism, which
        after the unification of Germany by Prussia under Bismarck in 1871,
        achieved by a series of carefully planned wars, led ultimately to WW1.

  <p>The Auckland Youth Orchestra is the premier regional youth orchestra in New Zealand. Our vision is to inspire young people to excellence through their love of musical performance and to provide them with a wide range of cultural experiences; thus shaping our leaders of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Founded in 1948, AYO was the first youth orchestra established in the Southern Hemisphere, designed to bridge the gap between school orchestras and adult professional groups. Since then, more than 2,600 young adults from diverse cultural and social backgrounds have passed through the ranks of the orchestra, having received expert training in orchestral playing. No other orchestral organisation or institution in New Zealand provides such a comprehensive programme to musicians up to the age of 28. </p>

  <p><b>Here plays the future</b></p>
  <p>We are always keen to hear from talented musicians between the ages of 15 and 28 to join the orchestra. There is a place for everyone in AYO - whether you are a polished performer, someone who wants to keep up their playing skills or get back into music after a break. Auditions for us are a formality to make sure everyone has an equal footing when it comes to part allocation and seating order.</p>
  <p>The first step to join AYO is to register for an audition. Contact us now at
  <a href="mailto:auditions@ayo.org.nz?Subject=Audition%20registration" target="_top">
  auditions@ayo.org.nz</a></p>
  <p>All you need to prepare is:</p>
  <p>1. A piece of your own choice - 5 minutes maximum; and <br/>
  2. Orchestral excerpts - usually 2 or 3. </p>
  <p><b>We look forward to hearing from you!</b></p>
