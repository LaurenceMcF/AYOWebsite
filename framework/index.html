  <p>The Auckland Youth Orchestra is the premier regional youth orchestra in New
  Zealand. Our vision is to inspire young people to excellence through their
  love of musical performance and to provide them with a wide range of cultural
  experiences, thus shaping our leaders of tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Founded in 1948, AYO was the first youth orchestra established in the
  Southern Hemisphere, designed to bridge the gap between school orchestras
  and adult professional groups. Since then, more than 2,600 young adults from
  diverse cultural and social backgrounds have passed through the ranks of the
  orchestra, having received expert training in orchestral playing. No other
  orchestral organisation or institution in New Zealand provides such a
  comprehensive programme to musicians up to the age of 28. </p>

  <p>The orchestra's training role is paramount, however it has developed
  an extended role as a performing and touring symphony orchestra. The
  orchestra regularly presents concerts in centres throughout New Zealand
  and has toured to Australia, New Caledonia, North America, and Europe.
  In August 2011, AYO travelled to Europe, being the first ensemble from
  New Zealand invited to perform at the renowned Young Euro Classic
  Festival in Berlin, Germany. In 2013, the orchestra toured the length
  of the South Island with concerts in Dunedin, Gore, Te Anau, Wanaka,
  Westport, and Nelson.</p>

  <p>The orchestra also showcases young soloists and composers. The AYO
  Concerto Competition offers existing orchestra members the chance to
  compete for a concerto appearance with the orchestra.  The orchestra
  accompanied Dame Kiri Te Kanawa in her youth, and more recently John
  Chen and Amitai Pati (Sol3Mio and Lexus Song Quest winner, 2012).</p>
  <p>We perform twelve excellent but affordable and accessible concerts
  annually across the greater Auckland metropolitan area, nationally and
  abroad, attracting audiences with diverse cultural and socio-economic
  backgrounds and of all ages. </p>

  <p>Not only are we training future musicians to feed into our national
  ensembles and orchestras but we also play an important audience
  development role as our members are likely to be future audiences
  and supporters of the arts.  AYO is a healthy social experience for
  young people and makes an important contribution to the cultural life
  of Auckland and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Many AYO alumni can be found in leading orchestras and ensembles around the
  world, teaching in conservatories, or performing as soloists and conductors.
  The co-operative structure of the orchestra provides members with
  organisational  and team building skills, engendering dedication, confidence,
  and self-esteem within  a positive peer environment. In today's world, this
  healthy social experience equips  our players with skills and a sense of
  achievement that will support them in whatever career path they choose.
  Indeed, many of our alumni are also found in business, politics,  and other
  professions.</p>
